# BreadboardComputer

The files in this repo are not overly well organised, meaning the layout of the contents of each document was made to just get the job done and I never intended them to be viewed by other people when I made them, I have since decided to share them but beware bugs and much repeated info in the instruction set spreadsheet.

Run the code on your Arduino Nano at your own risk, It was created for my hardware configuration so make sure you don't accidentally fry anything accidentally and check compatability with what you build :D
